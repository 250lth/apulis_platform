## 1.1 Product Overview

The AI platform is designed to provide an end-to-end AI solution to users from different industries and enable them to start the high-performance AI development work with significantly reduced ramp up time, thereby saving costs and improving efficiency. It will also provide a highly efficient, low cost private cloud AI solution for small and medium size company. 

The platform incorporates TensorFlow, PyTorch, MindSpore and other open source AI frameworks, thereby provides user friendly development environment for AI model training, auto ML, hardware status monitoring etc., making it very easy for AI developers to quickly develop AI application. It also has built-in comprehensive early warning system which can automatically alert the system administrator on any anomaly, thereby improve the platform efficiency and security. 

The platform adopts the lightweight virtualization technologies, such as Docker containers that containerizes one or more programs, and provide a standard management interface. Each container is separated from each other. Kubernetes clustering technology is used to orchestrate the containerized applications for planning, automated deployment, updates, and maintenance. 

## 1.2 Terminology 

| **Terms**      | **Definitions**                                              |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TensorFlow     | Developed by Google, TensorFlow is a large-scale deep learning framework on a distributed system. It has good portability, can run on mobile devices, and supports distributed multi-machine multi-device training. TensorFlow is very popular in the AI community, with a number of open-sourced of deep learning models. |
| PyTorch        | PyTorch is developed by the Facebook AI team. Unlike TensorFlow, PyTorch uses eager execution mode and is python native, makes it easy to learn and integrate with other Python packages. |
| MindSpore      | MindSpore is an AI computing framework developed by Huawei. It provides a unified framework for model development in data center to and model deployment in the edge devices. |
| Docker         | Docker is a set of open source applications that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called container. It can be published and run on many popular Linux or Windows machine. |
| Kubernetes     | Commonly stylized as k8s, is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling and management. It aims to provide a platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of allocation containers across clusters of hosts. |
| Jupyter        | Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment. It can connect to many kernels to allow programming in many languages. We use Jupyter Notebook to write model training code, to submit model training tasks, and to view results. |
| hyperparameter | In machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is used to control the learning process. By contrast, the values of other parameters (typically learnt weights) are derived via training. In general, it is necessary to optimize the hyperparameter and select a set of optimal hyperparameter for the learning machine to improve the performance and effectiveness of learning. |
| Job            | Model training tasks                                         |
| VC             | Virtual cluster                                              |
